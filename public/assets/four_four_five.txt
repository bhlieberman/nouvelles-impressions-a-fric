A trick which is worth as much as these, for novelty value:
To induce a hen to sit on an egg
Which was actually laid by a duck,
To see the hen trembling (around whom clucking,
Trying to get at the duck which is foreign to the brood,
Menacing, beaks at the ready, is all the farmyard)
Whilst the duckling pecks at her ankle;
Frightening an old lady
(A feeble one in whom the taste for celibacy
Was formed by fear of a drunken husband who would beat her,
Like the famous example of Bluebeard's widow)
By attaching a burning rag to her cat's tail
And making it run in terror towards her.

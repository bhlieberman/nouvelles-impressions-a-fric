To give an overcoat to the new arrival in Nice
(Ready as he is to swear - even on days when
Snowflakes big as coins float in the biting wind -
That in January one can happily go naked in Nice,
Just like Archimedes shouting out a hundred times "Eureka")
Is like giving:- to the novice at sea, an emetic,
When all he can hear is the wind getting up;
- To a member of the audience during a speaker's preambles,
A sleeping-draught; - to one in pursuit of
A fast walker, a fan; - when he gets home, to a sinner
Who has taken a late communion, a bitter walnut;
- A false nose to a Jew, smaller than his own hooter;
- Crazily, before a newly-pressed suit,
An aphrodisiac to the man about to hang; - bellows
To one who is furiously fighting a fire in a soot-filled
Chimney; - to he who is removing from an old and cherished book
A beautiful dried flower, a vice;
- To he who wisely leaves a spider in peace one evening,
Knowing this will bring good fortune, a lucky charm;
- As with kid gloves towards the holy water
She advances her trembling middle finger, to the devout lady, a charm
To prevent her from wasting away; - when the express, carriage after carriage,
Overtakes a slow train, to one who witnesses the contest,
A prediction as to the outcome; - in the evening, to one in his hut
Getting ready for bed in the dark, some hair curlers;
- As, stamping, into his numb fingers
A dyspeptic with bad breath blows, a ball
Of stinking air to his friend;
- An advantage to a steamship challenged by sail;
- To a pedestrian who is being overtaken by a saddled-up horse
Without rider, a double-slap on its back to make it trot;
- To the worker in June who, sewing without a machine
Pricks her finger, a rose to hold;
As he growls before attacking, a stroke
In the wrong direction down the dog's back;
- When he is beset on all sides, to the foul-mouthed emaciate
On the verge of ruin, a shaped block for enlarging hats;
- To a recluse, when outside the flags are slapping hard,
Many an undulating chromatic number on the flute;
- To one overwhelmed in contemplation of a storm,
The information that sound travels slower than light;
- To a whistler nearing the end of a song,
A slap on the back for each line of the refrain;
- A rest to a cock who, autumn going by apace, stamps frustratedly
As dawn is delayed; - to the Wandering Jew, a desk-job.

What prosperities, what fine fortunes,
To him who is not blind, clearly spring from an infamous source!
The piano prize depends more for the woman
Upon the number of admirers she has on the jury
Than upon her playing and upon her developed talents
Which she either reveals or not while playing her sonata;
Many an X... Spa owes less to its bicarbonate
Than to the gamblers who frequent its casino at night.

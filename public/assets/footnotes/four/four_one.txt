Everything progresses: as at the moment when, calling the hens,
Those wise early-to-bedders, in to roost,
The sun sinks in the west, the rich man (money
Improves his position of privilege;
The elegant dunce is sure to be outstripped in a college
Whose crest, through pride, the elbows of the student-body
Have vigorously rubbed to to a shining finish;
To a rich suicide one gives a mass:
It is hard to die without a De Profundis);
Has the wicks of his old lamps re-lit,
A gesture which electric light has rendered out-of-date;
The motorcar, causing the dropping of sticks,
Has brought animal transport into disrepute,
- Since which sparrows have had a hard time;
And are those awkward catapults a patch on cannon?

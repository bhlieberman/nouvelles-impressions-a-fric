What things one has to wait for, alas! the moment of the
Splash of a pebble which one has dropped down a well,
Public adulations - the celebrity having died
Only in death acquires the right to have his statue and his street -
The end when in cold water a sugar-cube is dissolving,
For the insomniac those patches of light on the ceiling
Which announce dawn and its splendours,
In all good books the removal of the obstacle
Which separates the hero from perfect happiness,
The young wife, when her womb is not becoming heavy,
The lapel of a uniform for a scarlet ribbon,
For the thunder, when the crash comes heavily
Only one minute after a feeble flash of lightning!

Nobody is without an ambitious dream;
The worker sees himself dictating, during a strike,
(Nowadays on uses reason and everybody, eye on his goal,
((We all have one; while the nape of his neck,
Bared to facilitate the action of the blade,
Is attached to his spine for another fifteen minutes,
Dreaming: "He loses his prisoner - and this often happens -
Who holds him the tightest", (((in fact, inconsequentialities
Can help the long-term prisoner to break gaol,
Like the cheese charmed from the bill of the crow
- It is often best to keep silent;)))
Even the murderer has a goal: escape;))
Whatever this ideal might be: to earn a large salary,
To have children, to have an abundant harvest,
Or to slow his heartbeat at will to achieve enlightenment,
Realises that in order to succeed it is better to think, to act,
Than to make - hard worker, barren wife,
Reaper or invalid - a wish at the moment when
A shooting-star falls across the sky;),
Tired of seeing the bourgeois live off his sweat,
(Often Paul suffered and worked for Peter;
Vespucci exploited Columbus's efforts;
And it is to bedeck a finger or a chemise with pearls
That an oyster works so hard;) terms to his employer;
The whore in her attic dreams of riding in a coach;
To see in his hands the amethyst and the crook
Is a dream dear to every young priest.
